## Clean up Gmail

![Screenshot of the Gmail modifications that this extension makes.](./example.webp)

This is a small Chrome extension to make the layout of Gmail a little more to my preference.

For Gmail inboxes that are segmented, this makes the segmentation less prominent visually.

# Chrome Manifest V3 Extension Example

This also serves as a working example of injecting JavaScript onto a page using [Chrome's Manifest V3](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/). I thought it would take 10 minutes to write this extension but because of lack of documentation and good example code it ended up taking a couple hours.

I am publishing the source code and publishing this on the Extension marketplace to hopefully help other developers who are looking for a quick code reference. There are some things that are not well explained or obvious that you have to do, and I've tried to detail them in code comments as best I can.
